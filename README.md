## Swarming LEDs for LED Fun
This project can be be applied to many projects. Our prototype has been in scarves. These can also go in all sorts of other places:

- Wearables such as scarves and hats.
- Bike safety helmet.
- Bike lights.

### Why these? What's the swarm?
The thing that makes this project unique is the swarm. We're working to establish a way for multiple projects to communicate so that you can sync up animations with friends or even strangers.

Cheap simple hardware that can be put together in a robust and ad-hoc way to
keep you safe for nights of partying, or bicycling. Keep your friends all in a group with a synchronized mobile light show.

### Materials / Shopping List
These are some of the materials we've used to build our own. You can pretty much bank on them workin for your project.
- [portable battery packs](https://smile.amazon.com/Smallest-Jackery-3350mAh-Portable-Charger/dp/B00L9F95RO/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=jackery+battery+pack&qid=1559954560&s=gateway&sr=8-8), not a bad idea to have two. These are small enough to fit inside of a fuzzy scarf, and they don't turn off on you. You can get a few hours out of one of these... Depends on the animation you run.
